# Web-Scraping-and-Text-Mining



## Introduction

Because PTT is a social platform that is very close to the masses today, we decided to obtain text data from PTT's **CVS (Convenience Store) discussion board** through a crawler, and crawl the articles in the "commodity" category. 

We want to analyze the two leading convenience stores **Family and 7-11**, we will score the Family and 7-11 seperately and analysis those feedback messages.

We look forward to drawing some useful conclusions through the process of text analysis of the "experience" part in the article, and we can know which convenience store is the better choice when it comes to different shopping needs.

The main analysis methods and techniques used in this project include **web crawlers, statistical charts and visualization, TF-IDF and Word Cloud**.
